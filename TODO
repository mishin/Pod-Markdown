Test how YAML's pod would output by default...
determine if the suggestion is to utf8::upgrade...

* =pod E<quot>  returns a native  string; upgrade doesn't change it
* =pod E<copy>  returns a native  string; upgrade converts
* =pod E<diams> returns a unicode string

Specifying any =encoding will return a unicode string
