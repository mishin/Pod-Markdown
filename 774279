It gets pretty complex:

Pod::Man: Always encodes both © and E<copy> as “X”.
Pod::Text - with encoding declared in my POD: Both © and E<copy> are translated correctly.
Pod::Text - without encoding declared in my POD: Both © and E<copy> are translated as 0xA9.
Pod::Html always encodes either © or E<copy> correctly as &copy; — even if I don’t set the encoding.
Pod::Markdown  always encodes either © or E<copy> as 0xA9 whether or not encoding is declared in my POD.

I understand that the whole purpose of Markdown is to be readable even if it isn’t displayed as a formatted document. HTML entities certainly don’t help.

What about this:

Lower ASCII printable characters (0x20 through 0x7E) are always translated correctly
If I declare an encoding scheme, Pod::Markdown should translate the characters like Pod::Text does.
If I don’t declare an encoding scheme, and I use E<xxx> in my POD, all characters not in the range 0x20 to 0x7E should be converted into HTML entities. I’ll be happy if this required a command line option.
